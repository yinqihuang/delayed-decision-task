Use the mini-grid environment (https://github.com/maximecb/gym-minigrid) to create a delayed decision task. Each episode starts by a view of the empty grid. Then a random image of a shape (square, triangle, circle) is shown in one of the squares (cue). The color, size and exact location of the shape within the grid-location is randomized. After a random number of delay frames, images of two shapes are shown in two random gridlocations (tests). The shape in one of the “test” images matches that in the “cue” image. The correct action is to select the grid-location containing the matching test image.
